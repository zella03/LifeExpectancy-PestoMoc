    <h1>Is life expectancy directly correlated with addictions?</h1>
    <h2>2019 deaths per capita in Europe</h2>

    <div id="comment" class="description-container">
        The heatmap reveals weak correlations between life expectancy and various substance use disorders, indicating that while there is some relationship, it is not strong enough to suggest that these factors significantly impact life expectancy. Since the correlations are low, we can reasonably conclude that substance use disorders do not strongly influence life expectancy on a population level.

Life expectancy is primarily shaped by a broader combination of factors such as healthcare quality, economic stability, education, environmental conditions, and social support. These factors have a more substantial and direct impact on ensuring longer and healthier lives, often outweighing the effects of substance use disorders.

Moreover, it is worth noting that substance use disorders tend to be more prevalent in wealthier countries. In these countries, the negative effects of substance use may be partially mitigated by the advantages of better healthcare systems, higher economic stability, greater educational opportunities, cleaner environments, and stronger social safety nets. These compensating factors help maintain relatively high life expectancy even in the presence of substance use disorders.

It is also important to clarify that substance use disorders encompass issues related to alcohol and all illicit drugs (including opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, and cannabis) but do not include smoking. The relatively low correlations observed in this analysis suggest that, while substance use disorders are a concern, they are not a dominant driver of life expectancy trends.</div>
