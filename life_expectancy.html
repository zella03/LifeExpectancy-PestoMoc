                    Looking across the years, one country consistently stands out among the top three for life expectancy: <b>Switzerland</b>.
                    <br>
                    With only a few exceptions, Switzerland has maintained its position as a global leader in longevity. Other countries that frequently appear in the top three include Spain, Italy, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
                    <br>
                    What makes these nations so remarkable? Could it be their healthcare systems, dietary habits, or social stability?

                        Another thing that is important to be mentioned is that there is a clear difference in life expectancy between men and women. Generally, <b style="color: palevioletred;">women</b> tend to live longer than men, which can be attributed to a variety of biological, social, and lifestyle factors.
