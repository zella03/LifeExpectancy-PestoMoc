            <p>Spanning the years 2000-2021 it becomes evident that most of the countries with high healthcare expenditure
                 per capita (Germany, Norway, Switzerland) are located in the <b>western part of Europe.</b> 
                 <br><br>In recent years, <strong>Switzerland</strong> stands out with the <b>highest per capita expenditure</b>.
                 We should know that per capita expenditres are more reliable than total expenditures as they reflect the amount spent
                 relative to each population unit, correlating to better life quality of individuals and individuals well-being.
                 When switching to total expenditures, the map reveals that <b>wealthier nations</b> not only have higher per 
                 capita spending but also <b>dominate</b> in healthcare expenditure.</p>

        <h3>We are living longer, longer, and longer...</h3>
        <p>Life expectancy improvements often correlate with healthcare spending increases.
            We can conclude that there is a <b>small</b> but <b>positive</b> relationship between those two values!
            <p>You remember the countries we compared at the end of GDP section? Looking at the <b class="lightblue-text">Russian Federation</b> and the <b class="pink-text">United 
                Kingdom</b>, we can observe something interesting. Over the same time period, both countries saw an increase in healthcare spending. However, 
            despite spending less on healthcare, <b class="lightblue-text">Russia</b> experienced a significantly <b>higher rate of growth</b> in
             life expectancy compared to the UK.
            <br>
            <br>In contrast, the <b class="pink-text">United 
                Kingdom</b>, which is actually allocating more resources to healthcare, 
            saw a <b>relatively smaller improvement</b> in life expectancy during the same time period!<br>
            It can be seen that we face <b>overall increase in many european countries in healthcare spending</b>. Given this correlation, <strong>we are going to live longer!</strong></p>

            Life Expectancy data was transformed into a long format, we renamed the columns, 
            extracted the years and exported into yearly subsets to CSV files.
            <br><br>
            Healthcare dataset was reshaped it to long format using, extracted years, 
            dropped rows with missing values, and 
            converted healthcare expenditure from USD to EUR using a conversion rate (0.97).
            <br><br>
            Datasets were loaded and merged together on 
            country and year.
            Additinally total healthcare expenditure was calculated (by multiplication using population), and then again saved to yearly datasets.
            <br><br>
            To display countries on a map some of the countries names needed to be standardized to the ones from geojson file.
