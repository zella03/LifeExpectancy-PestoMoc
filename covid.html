        <h3>The Pandemic That Changed the World</h3>
        <p><b>Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)</b> is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused 
            by the novel coronavirus <b>SARS-CoV-2</b>. First identified in late 2019, it rapidly 
            evolved into a global pandemic, disrupting lives, economies, and healthcare systems. 
            <br>Characterized by symptoms ranging from mild coughs to severe respiratory distress, the 
            <b>virus has profoundly impacted public health</b> and highlighted the importance of global 
            collaboration in combating emerging diseases.

            <h3>Life Expectancy Drops Significantly After COVID</h3>
            <p>From years, we clearly observed a steady <b>increase in life expectancy</b>, as people across Europe were living longer year by year. Unfortunately, this positive trend was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            
            <p><b class="darkblue-text">Andorra</b> experienced the <b>highest decline</b> in life expectancy, with a drop of <b class="darkred-text">-4.68 years</b> between 2019 and 2020.
                This means that, during this period, people in Andorra were expected to live <b>nearly 5 years shorter</b> than before the pandemic hit.
                Many countries have quickly recovered, returning to pre-pandemic life expectancy levels and resuming the upward trend.</p>

            Life Expectancy data was transformed into a long format, we renamed the columns, 
            extracted the years and exported into yearly subsets to CSV files.
            <br><br>
            Covid 19 Pandemics dataset was filtered for the lastest possible day in dataset '2024-02-15' and saved to separate file.
            <br><br>
            To display countries on a map some of the countries names needed to be standardized to the ones from geojson file.
