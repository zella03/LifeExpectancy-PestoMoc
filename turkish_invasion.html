            <h3>Little history..</h3>
            <p>
                The Turkish invasion of Cyprus began on <b>20 July 1974</b> and progressed in two phases over the following month. 
                Taking place upon a background of intercommunal violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and in response to a Greek junta-sponsored 
                Cypriot coup d'état five days earlier, it led to the Turkish capture and occupation of the northern part of the island.
                <br><br>
                The Turkish forces landed in Cyprus on 20 July and captured 3% of the island before a ceasefire was declared. 
                The Greek military junta collapsed and was replaced by a civilian government. Following the breakdown of peace talks, 
                Turkish forces enlarged their original beachhead in August 1974 resulting in the capture of approximately 36% of the island.
                The ceasefire line from August 1974 became the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus and is commonly referred to as the Green Line.
                <br><br>
                The Turkish invasion ended in the partition of Cyprus along the UN-monitored Green Line, which still divides Cyprus, and the formation of a de facto Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration in the north.

            <h3>War has strong influence</h3>
            <p>
                As we can see from the chart, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus had a significant impact on life expectancy. It illustrates a sharp decline but only for the year of the invasion.
                The reason for that is the fact that life expectancy is calculated for the current mortality rates, and the war caused a significant increase in mortality rates. What is also
                important to mention is that the time of each war and invasion is not predictable. That is why in a year we notice a significant decrease in life expectancy, but in the following years,
                the life expectancy is back to normal.<br><br>
                Turning on the checkbox and analyzing the life expectancy of female against male we can notice that female life expectancy experienced only a slight decrease compared to men.
                We can conclude that during this invasion in the group of people that were fighting and dying were mostly men - that is why we see such a decrease.
