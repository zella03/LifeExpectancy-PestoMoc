            <h3>Little history..</h3>
            <p>
                The Turkish invasion of Cyprus began on <b>20 July 1974</b> and progressed in two phases over the following month. 
                Taking place upon a background of intercommunal violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and in response to a Greek junta-sponsored 
                Cypriot coup d'état five days earlier, it led to the Turkish capture and occupation of the <u>northern part of the island</u>.
                <br><br>
                The Turkish forces landed in Cyprus on 20 July and captured 3% of the island before a ceasefire was declared. 
                The Greek military junta collapsed and was replaced by a civilian government. Following the breakdown of peace talks, 
                Turkish forces enlarged their original beachhead in August 1974 resulting in the capture of approximately 36% of the island.
                The ceasefire line from August 1974 became the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus and is commonly referred to as the Green Line.
                <br><br>
                The Turkish invasion ended in the partition of Cyprus along the UN-monitored Green Line, which still divides Cyprus, and the formation of a de facto Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration in the north.

            <h3>War has a strong influence</h3>
            <p>
                As demonstrated in the chart, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus had a <b>significant impact</b> on life expectancy in the year of the invasion. 
                However, this impact was only temporary, with life expectancy returning to its previous levels in subsequent years. 
                This is due to the fact that life expectancy is calculated based on <u>current</u> mortality rates, which were significantly affected by the war.
                It is also important to note that the timing of wars and invasions is not predictable. Consequently, a significant decrease in life expectancy may 
                be observed in a given year, followed by a return to normal levels in subsequent years.
                <br><br>
                Examining the data, it becomes evident that the life expectancy of females did not undergo a substantial decline when compared to that of males. 
                This observation indicates that, during the aforementioned invasion, the proportion of <b>male casualties were predominantly higher</b>.

                Life Expectancy data was transformed into a long format, we renamed the columns, 
                extracted the years and exported into yearly subsets to CSV files.
                <br><br>
                Data were filtered to obtain the life expectancy values only for Cyprus from 1968 to 1978.
